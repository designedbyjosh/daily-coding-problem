 description: "This problem was asked by Google. Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical. For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8. In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects. Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space."

There are several approaches to tackling this problem, first things first, what are our assumptions? Do we assume that both lists are the same length? If so, it's a fairly trivial problem requiring just two separate loops running through each linked list. If we're assuming that both lists are not the same length, however, requires us to delve a little bit deeper.

```This solution will be posted tomorrow though. This is a test of the integration with the blog for the time being.```

Looks like things are going well though!
